    ----  -------  ----  --------------
    1/26  08:00pm  1:00  Read assignment and figured out how to interact with the zoo + SFTP
    1/28  12:00pm  0:45  Remotely set up the zoo on vscode and read more of my assignment
    1/28  07:00pm  0:45  Figuring out how std in works and writting pseudocode
    1/28  11:00pm  0:45  I have just been trying to draft out what the structure of my code is supposed to look like
                            but i keep confusing myself. Going to sleep and see if it makes sense in the morning
    1/29  07:00pm  1:00  At office hours and it is finally starting to make sense. I have already passed the first test using a functional 
                            finite state machine. I realized that I didn't have to think about all the cases at one time but am supposed to
                            go and improve the code as I see the test errors. 
    1/29  08:00pm  1:00  Passed a couple more test cases(I think 4 now). I am going to run the test script now to see which ones i failed and why
    1/29  09:00pm  1:00  Passed all the test cases up to line splices (the first 9 I think). I also did some research about what line splices are and how to approach them
                            so i think i know what I need to do.
    1/30  12:45pm  0:45  I started trying to figure out line splicing but changing the code for splicing inside a comment has made me fail a bunch of 
                            tests. I think i need to change my functional state structure and store the states in variables to avoid having to handle line splicing multiple times
	1/30  01:45pm  1:00  Diagnosed why I was failing line splicing and started rededsigining my code to deal with line splices in one place
    1/30  03:00pm  1:00  I have reformatted the code and I am passing 11 tests again. I am back to the issue of line splicing though and
                            have been stuck on public test 12.
    1/30  04:00pm  1:00  I got my line splice bug fixed but I am still running into the problem where I don't have leave state 5(backslash detected state)
                            so i have a problem with the file not registering identifiers because it expects a comment. I also need to deal with numeric constants
	1/30  06:30pm  1:00  I was finally able to find all of my public test cases. I also made progress on how to leave the 5th state
                            I have also started testing random c code online to see how my code responds to it vs. how the staff solution responds to it
    1/30  07:45pm  1:00  I have been working on testing more and more edge cases but haven't been very succesful. I figured out how to leave state 5 though. 
    1/30  11:00pm  1:00  I started passing a lot more test cases. I realized little quirks in the staff solution like underscores are considered an identifier so I should be taking a lot closer
                            look at stuff like that.
    1/30  12:00pm  1:00  I fixed an issue where an underscore would still be used as a break within identifiers. I am also reformating the format of the log file and
                            my source code so that it meets the formatting requirments.

    I discussed my solution with: 
    Wednesday, February 19th
    I asked Daniel Hodeta questions about c cyntax because I couldn't find how i was supposed to deal with quotes/strings and
        preprocessing directives. He just told me to search up escape characters and that how the characters. He also explained to me what ungetchar did
        but we didn't discuss solutions.
    Difficulties
    - Navigating the zoo is really difficult using the terminal. I have created a new file to keep track of the directories but
        I think i need a more powerful IDE to handle multitasking. I will go through the VS code remote setup steps that one of the TA's 
        posted on the mailing list and hope that it works. 
    - I am having a really hard time with the C cyntax. I keep trying to have escape characters for recognizing 
        quotes and proceeding to a function but it keeps highlighting the wrong thing. I am also having a hard time
        organizing my thoughts and making a coherent structure to my code.
    - My functional state design made dealing with line splices really difficult because i had to deal with line splices with each cases and it wasn't central. I
        had to revert to reformatting my code to just the main function to allow myself to generally deal with line splices at the top. 
    - I don't know if line splicing with functions is a good idea because i need a condition for it whenever I am inside the states. i don't have too many states
        though so I might be fine if i have it check in main and in all of the states as well.
