    ----  -------  ----  --------------
    2/08  04:45pm  1:00  I was mostly trying to figure out how to use command line arguments and fo
                                typer conversions
    2/09  07:30pm  1:00  I spent most of the time trying to figure out why I kept getting the Segmentation fault (core dumped) 
                                and was able to figure it out using Valgrind after one of the ULA's suggested it to me in office hours
                                I am currently working on dealing with the command line arguments
    2/09  08:30pm  0:30  I spent most of the time trying to figure out how to get the string command line inputs but I have a bug with
                                my implementation of strcmp that i need to fix
    2/10  08:00pm  1:00  I figured out how to fix all of my segmentation errors and process command line inputs but most of the time was
                                was spent trying to figure out what the homework guidelines are asking for and what pointer notation is 
    2/10  10:33pm  1:00  I think I understand exactly what the program specifications mean so I am finally stating to actually code and am
                                working on implementing my first fit algorithm. I still have a lot of errors though
    2/11  11:50pm  1:00  I finally got first first to work and reformated my items structure so that the inital array that holds the items
                                doesn't have any empty values.
    2/11  02:23pm  1:00  I have been trying to get insertion sort to work but I have this bug that i can't seem to figure out                           
    2/11  03:55pm  1:00  I figured out my bug for insertion sort. I realized that I was overhtinking it and not shifiting the arrays down. I also
                                realized that I was shifting it in increasing order and fixed it. That was just reversing some equality operations though.
    2/11  05:00pm  0:20  I outlined the genreal structure for bestfit. It is currently not working prolly becasue of some bad assignment but
                                that shouldn't be too hard to fix if I trace the program
    2/12  05:00pm  0:40  I fixed best fit. Turns out it was just a bad index assignment. I set binIdx to minIdx which was 0 which put me in an infinite loop
                                I fixed that and ran the public test for the first time and realised i am only passing 3 tests and that my ffd algorithm and others aren't working.
    2/13  12:02am  0:45  I created the intial outline for the -opt flag. I pretty much translated the pseudocode on the assignment specifications but it looks like I have a
                                segmentation error. I used Valgrind and it says that the issue is i am going out of bounds and i think i fixed that but it is now saying that 
                                it can't grow the stack which i haven't encoutnered before
    2/13  12:15pm  0:45  I fixed my bug with the general recursive model for backtracking. I realized that I wasn't checking if the bins were overflowing and I was also calculating the
                                number of non-empty boxes from the items array and not the bins array. I haven't properly tested the problem because the sample respones take too long but I
                                think most of the base logic is right. I also don't have an additional empty bin as suggested by the pseudocode so I have to figure out what that means. Nvm
                                I did one more test and it said 1 for ./Binpack 100 31 41 59 26 52 -opt-opt 1 which shouldn't be possible
    2/11  03:00pm  1:00  I figured out the major bug in my code which was that I wasn't adding the items into the preexisting bin but rather replacing them. I reformated my for loop to look
                                like the pseudo code as well but idk what i'm doing wrong. I'm pretty sure my problem is that i am not handling the incomplete leafs properly but i don't know how
                                to fix it
    2/11  06:00pm  1:00  I am just struggling with trying to figure out what is going wrong with the recursion function    
    2/11  07:00pm  1:00  I was using c++ and c-- to change the paramater of the indexes which was not what i was supposed to do, I was just supposed to change the cIdx
                                value for the parameter so I just needed to use c+1
    2/11  07:00pm  1:00  I am passing 7 tests now and so i just need to figure out where i should put my B and C heuristsics
    2/11  08:00pm  1:00  I am still trying to figure out what is going wrong with my B and C herusitics, I am starting to draw out simple solutions that rely on these heuristics so
                                that i can make debugging easier for myself. 
    2/11  09:00pm  1:00  Mostly trying to figure out my Heuristic b is not working 
    2/11  10:00pm  1:00  I got Huristics A to D to work by implementation for heuristic E is causing D to fail 
    2/12  11:00pm  1:00  I tried to figure out how to deal with erraneous input but it is trating every bin as incorrect input for some reason
    2/13  01:00pm  1:00  I created a seperate funciton to deal with erraneous input because atoi interprets +11 and -11 and other erraneous inputs as their actual int conversion so I created
                                another funciton that iterates through the string inputs and checks if each char is a digit. I also discovered a bug when testting public test 13 which is that my
                                bf isn't printing for some reason for the inputs 1 1
    2/13  03:00pm  1:00  I spent most of the time commenting my code and trying to trace my code for opt
    2/13  04:00pm  1:00  I am starting to print when items are added and removed to try and figure out why my backtracking is so slow
    2/13  11:52pm  1:00  I figured out how to use the built in vs code debugger and realized that my heuristic E wasn't resetting the toggle after the end of the bins and my for loop was also 
                                outside the bin assignment for loop which should not have happened.

    I discussed my solution with: 

    Difficulties:
    The most difficult part of the entire program was undoubtdetely the opt backtracking function and that was simply because that was very hard to diagnose. I know that the pseudocde for the general function was 
    published but my biggest problem was that i didn't really undertstand why we had to put it into one empty bin at first because of the wording so i was placing the item into every possible bin. The list of permutations 
    did decrease signficantly once i only put items into one empty bin but it took a very long time for me to figure it out. My other big problem was obviously also the Heurisitics because I coldn't diagnose simple problems
    without figuring out how to use gdb or the built in vs code debugger. This made it very difficult to diagnose especially when my Heurisitc E started messign with my tests for the other Heuristics.
