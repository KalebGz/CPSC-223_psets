    ----  -------  ----  --------------
    03/28  08:02pm  1:00  I had a hard time trying to figure out the syntax for creating the deque struct and where i needed to intiialize the
                            fields for the struct.(I am especially having a hard time understanding the mention of a variable after the defnition of a struct
    03/28  12:45pm  1:00  I figured out that most of my comfusion stemmed from me interpretting the reading as telling me that the variables defined after the
                            defintion of a struct as syntax for automatically mallocing space for the given struct given those varaibles which didn't make sense.
                            I realized that this confusion was because the walkthrough used different versions of using typedef and so i didn't know that those variables
                            after the defintion of a struct were simply for renaming the datatype. I was able to write the functions up to headD() after that
    03/29  07:35pm  1:00  I finished my deque implementation and figured out how to test my implementation but i realized that I was having memeory problems and when diagnosing
                            that i realized that i implemented my remD without copying the tail stack onto the head if the stack is empty which made me realize that I implemted 
                            my stacks wrong because the pointers in the deque struct point to the end of the stack(top) which isn't right beacuse I can't go backwards when copying
    03/29  07:35pm  1:00  I realized that my stack implementation isn't wrong and after implenting remD, I have been messign around with testDeque to see if my deque works and making lottle
                            changes to my other functions.
    03/30  10:02pm  1:00  My deque.c implementation seg faults whenever trying to print from the tail stack for some reason so i've just been trying to debug that
    03/31  02:32pm  0:30  I was able to fix the seg fault and the double freeing error that i was running into but i am still not 100% sure my Deque implementation works because I was getting random
                            errors but then i remade example and everything started giving me the same output as Correct so who knows
    03/31  04:51pm  1:00  I did as much testing as I could with deque including the begining 200 tests on the public tests and i didn't come up with any errors so I am pretty confident in their functionality
                            I then started working on qsort and was able to figure out flag parsing.
    03/31  07:31pm  1:00  I went to office hours and got help figuring out how to test my deque implementation and figured out how to properly test my Qsort and Deque. I also create the base code for reading Files
                            for Qsort and i am in a position to start sketching out my insertion sort implementation for Qsort. I still need to tests my file input and dealing system.
    03/31  07:31pm  1:00  I've been trying to understand quicksort and tried to approach it by programming the base recursive function but realized that i hav no understanding as to how the logic works so i've been 
                            drawing out the theory with deques. I also messed around with edge casing for the flags a bit but isdigit acts weird with longs for some reason.
    04/01  07:31pm  1:00  Implemented error free file reading system and drew out the algorithm for quicksort with 2 stacks and a queue
    04/02  07:31pm  1:00  I started writting out the structure for the recursive function and as I was setting up the orientation of the the deques before first being inputted into the recursive function, i realised that
                            my algorithm doesn't really work because storing the pivot doesn't reallly work so i am just dealing with the pre quicksort Deques and going to redo the theory
    04/03  04:15pm  1:00  I kept on having problems with saving my pivots and so I took a long time going over my implementation of the deque before realizing that I was just setting up my inputs to remD incorrectly and I
                            also took a long time developing sanity check procedures to check the status of my queues and problems with the files that I created like existence of new line character made me take the time to
                            go into trying to understand the functionality of functions like printf() when i just needed to click enter once on my inputted file
    04/03  04:15pm  1:00  I spent some time tracing  the algorithm and was going back and forth trying to copy the logic into code and realizeing kinks/edge cases i need to deal with. I think my implementation is wrong though
                            because it doesn't use the tip from note 5
    04/04  12:02pm  1:00  I realized that there was no reason for trying to implement this program just using stacks and I realized that using 1 stack and 1 queue to sort/partition and 1 stack for storing the sorted array,
                            my algorithm would work so i have just been trying to reformat it for that and trying to get rid of the irrelevant code that i wrote to try make partitioning with 2 stacks work.
    04/05  11:02pm  1:00  Reformating the previous code into the new algorithm was a bad idea and I can't use the head function to check the status of the deques so I have been making small changes constantly and it's hard to debug
                            so one thing is messing up another thing and i've just been stuck in a sad loop. I've got a variable in the recursive fn that will print the status of the deques(only once though) so debugging has become a little
                            easier but it's still difficult. I was thinking about implementing a headD like f(n) that wouldn't flip the outputs for stacks but i don't know if that would work/if it would be worth it because i have to change the makefile
                            devlop the function and then change it all back at the end
    04/06  11:02am  1:00  Finally figured out how to use the VS code debugger which has made debugging so much faster because i just have to click one button to see the status of the variables inside the deques throughout the different calls to quicksort
    04/06  01:58pm  0:30  I am trying to reformat my algorithm to work with the example from the walkthrough now
    04/06  03:28pm  1:00  I got the example from the walkthrough to work but i realized that the implementation was very case specific so i have to fix it
    04/06  05:28pm  1:00  I am not sure what the base case is supposed to be because i have too many if statements which are messing up with each new input
    04/07  12:10pm  1:00  I realized that I was going about the partitioning system wrong as i was trying to sort both stacks withing one call of the recursive function but now i have restarted and am tyring to sort one stack and then passing the
                            two different stacks to it one after the other and then pushing the pivot in between those two
    04/07  01:20pm  1:00  I have a partially working quick sort function but I'm having a difficult time integrating the sorting of the items right of the pivot
    04/07  06:20pm  1:00  I am close but I am missing an important part of the process on how the differnt recursive calls are integrated
    04/07  08:12pm  1:00  Went to office hours and removed my base case for the second stack and it made it easier to think about the recursive nature of this function and I started reformat it
    04/07  10:02pm  1:00  I started passing 2 tests from test.Qsort after implementing the integration of the second stack properly(Having it ordered in descending order)
    04/08  12:12pm  1:00  The qsort function is working for the most time. I was mostly just debugging valgrind errors for when using strlen()
    04/08  03:32pm  1:00  I haven't made much progress. My qsort function messes up for really large values for some reason(lost nodes and wrong order) and i've been truing to debug it.
    04/08  03:32pm  1:00  I realized i was apssing in the wrong parameter for the number of items in numres when sorting the right stack and everything works

    I discussed my solution with: 
    

    Difficulties:
  The memeory allocation systems of structs doesn't really seem very intuitive. I was especially confused by 
how a variable after the defintion of a struct functions and what it's purpose was.
This is probably one of the hardest things that i have to work on because I am really bad at thinking about recursion.
I approached it with a top down version and spent 2 days doing useless working trying to implement a recursive function
that had for loops and attempted to sort one level of the quicksort call for both stacks and I not sure right now exactly what I
was trying to do but it wasn't effective. This was also a wake up call for my trash notation and diagraming skills because I would
regularly get confused when trying to test inputs by hand. I threw myself into the code before understanding what its supposed to do
and i paid the price. :(
