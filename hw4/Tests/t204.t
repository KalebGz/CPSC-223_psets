 the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble

   There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,

 Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one
 end of the table.

   Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
 but tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.
