    Date  Started  Spent Work completed
    ----  -------  ----  --------------
    02/21  05:45pm  1:00  I spent most of the time trying to understand stdin and stdout functions and printing the status of char arrays.
                                    I also copied the getline function written on the spec and am trying to figure out how it works rn.
    02/21  09:45pm  1:00  I think i have a good idea of how to get input for standard in and the command line arguments, I have gotten an ouput from them
                                    Most of this hour was spend just looking at the test cases and making sure that I have a good idea what is a viable input.
    02/22  12:06pm  1:00  I was just messing around with pointers again and trying to create pointres to save the order and substitution rules
    02/25  12:16pm  1:00  Outlined my plan for dealing with the different rules and how my string substitution is suppsoed to work. I am still a bit confused
                                    as to how this would be possible without realloc and just strDup but I am now planning on concatting the differnt sections of
                                    the replaced string and then reallocing if the size is different.
    02/22  01:26pm  1:00  I was able to use strDup to create something that substitututes correctly for the q subtule but I run into an infinite loop for
                                      r and it doesn't seem to work for s. I also realize that I haven't been freeing properly so I am trying to retrace my code
                                      and figure out which library funcitons use malloc because I don't directly call it.
    02/26  07:26pm  1:00  I was able to implement the rule order system into the for loop but I haven't really been able to test it yet because I am not freeing
                                      my malloced(actually strnduped) strings and so it's hard to check what the actual problem is. I just realized when writting this
                                      that I can use the examples on the spec sheet and prolly just go into the test folder and copy some of the test cases to test this.
                                      The logic seemed pretty simple so it should work but i'm not sure. Other than that, I was just trying to understand my valgrind errors
                                      for most of this time. I just don't know what to do with the double free detected in tcache 2 error right now as well
    02/26  09:55pm  0:20  My multi rule system wasn't working but after a bit of debugging i realized that I was passing the original string to the new rules which was
                                      incorrect and so i reset the pointer of the old string to point to the new one. This is probably going to make freeing memoty a little
                                      more difficult though so i need to worry about that again.
    02/26  12:30pm  1:00  I have the base logic for everything with the expection of the back slash down but I figured out that i should probably approach the front characters
                                      before the substitution function because as stan said, it would make it very difficult. Most of the time here was spent on trying to free
                                      the heap and also mallocing for strcat
    02/27  12:30am  1:00  I spent most of the time trying to refactor my code to a malloced pointer that the strings are being concatoneted into but strcat works in mysterious ways so
                                        I'm probably going to have to just create my own function to do that.
    02/27  02:30am  1:00  I freed a bunch of memory and the program seems to not be having any memory leak issues which is wonderful. There is some bug with the -n that i need to fix now
                                        though.
    02/27  02:30pm  1:00  I realized that the end substring being concatonating was causing problems and spent the entire time disecting the substitute function and realized that I
                                        wasn't mallocing the proper length and tried to copy the null terminator from the end substring which caused invalid read errors. I fixed that though
                                        and am passing 11 out of the 14 tests now.
    02/27  04:00pm  1:00  I started to deal with escape characters. I am running into this issue where some variables aren't being reset with different line inputs
    02/27  05:40pm  0:50  I realized that i was implementing the backslash incorrectly becauese i thought that it should still trigger the only work on the first/last index. I removed the
                                        toggle and stopped the differnt states from changing Fi mutliple times by setting up  the backslash check before the +/- check adn it worked.
    2/27  07:30pm  1:00   Test 12 wasn't working because of a time issue. I refactored my code to not have to duplicate one array but that didn't help much. I then realized that i was recalculating
                                        the length of strings for every iteration of 3 for loops and the code started working after i saved those values into a variable instead of recalculating them
    2/27  09:40pm  1:00   I was just writing out Edge cases for most of the time that usually dealth with the plus minus charactersitics and the /. I also realized that there was a bug in my implementation
                                        of the backlash removal of the - (only replace end operaration) as i wasn't looking at the length of the modfied string
    2/27  11:50pm  1:00   I've been trying to get the + - edge case to work with little success. strDup for some reason incorrectly copies the inputed line
    2/28  12:50pm  1:00   I think i got the + - bounds to work but it just acts up for multiple rules implementing it. I am not trying to figure out how well it works just for + and - arguments
       ----
                   16:10  TOTAL time spent

    I discussed my solution with:
    Anthony Jiang: I briefly explained to him how you could do arithmethic on pointers

    Difficulties:

    I thought that the escaped fences were really hard to deal with. This was especially because i didn't have a good understanding of how the fences were supposed to work when i implemented them
    so i just used the first tests case and modified my program to work for that and then spent a decent chunk of time modifying my code for escaped +/- indicators only to find that I had implemented
    the who escape system incorrectly. Another very troubling issue was replacing strings bound on both sides by + and -. Trying to check for this full string replacement in my substitute function kept
    on giving me a seg fault so I had to go to where the swap configurations were being read and manually change the output string by having 2 different states. It has memory errors when more than one
    set of swaps(Fi and Ti) is given but it works alroght otherwise.
